# HBASE Private Branch

This project is a private branch derived from Apache Hbase 

## Apache HBASE 

Apache HBase [1] is an open-source, distributed, versioned, column-oriented
store modeled after Google' Bigtable: A Distributed Storage System for
Structured Data by Chang et al.[2]  Just as Bigtable leverages the distributed
data storage provided by the Google File System, HBase provides Bigtable-like 
capabilities on top of Apache Hadoop

## Major MileStone

* **New rpc layer **: 
  Use Netty to facilitate the rpc, take the advantage of the direct buffer and EventLoop thread mechanism.
* **Direct Health Check**: 
  With regard to original health check setting, the health check chore is fired up by the server itself, in order to detect the hanging machine which wouldnâ€™t allow new threads to be initiated.
* **New Encoding **: 
  Put Binary Search inside the file to achieve acceleration of the read operation and improvement of space usage. 
* **Overall Level Balancer **: 
  Simple balancer can only gurantee table level balance or cluster level, we need to empower the balancer by enable balance both at table level and cluster level
* **put Stage Event Driven**: 
  Separate the handler of CPU bounding activities from I/O bounding activities
